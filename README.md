SRT411A0
----------------
In this assignment I made to work through a set of exercises called "Todo" in the document that was proved in the assignment file. This document is called "A (very) short introduction to R". In this exercise I had to write R command to fulfill the requirement of each exercise. Then take this code add put them into a Rmd file to show both the code I created and the graphs/data generated from these codes. This file also includes my username for GitHub, a link to the document used in this assignment, and the link to all sources that I used to complete this assignment. Then using knitr to generate a pdf file with the contains of the Rmd file. After this, then upload this file, the Rmd file and the PDF file into a repository called "SRT411 Assignment 0" on my GitHub account. 

In order to do these exercises you would need to have the following:
- The computer language R install on your system
- You will need to have the program R studio on your computer to write and run the exercises
- You needed to install knitr so that you can create the Rmd file
- In order to get Todo 6, 8, and 9, you need to give the full path of the files when calling them. This is needed to get them to run.

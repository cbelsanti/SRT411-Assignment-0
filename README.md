SRT411A0
----------------
In this assigment I made to work through a set of exercises called "Todo" in the document that was provied in the assigment file. This document is called "A (very) short introduction to R". In this exercise I had to write R command to fulfill the requrirement of each execise. Then take this code add put them into a Rmd file to show both the code I created and the graphs/data generated from these codes. This file also includes my username for github, a link to the document used in this assigment, and the link to all sources that I used to complete this assigment. Then using knitr to generate a pdf file with the contains of the Rmd file. After this, then upload this file, the Rmd file and the pdf file into a repository called "SRT411 Assignment 0" on my github account. 

In order to do these exercises you would need to have the following:
- The computer language R install on your system
- You will need to have the program Rstudio on your computer to write and run the exercises
- You needed to install knitr so that you can create the Rmd file
- In order to get Todo 6, 8, and 9, you need to give the full path of the files when calling them. This is needed to get them to run.
